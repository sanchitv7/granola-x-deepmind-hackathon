# 🤖 Agentic Recruiter Platform

An AI-powered recruiting platform that automates candidate sourcing, matching, personalized outreach, and status tracking with a Tinder-style swipe interface.

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent System (Sequential Pipeline)

Four specialized AI agents working together:

1. **Sourcing Agent**: Generates 20-25 realistic mock candidate profiles based on job description
2. **Matching Agent**: Ranks candidates with AI-powered fit scoring (0-100)
3. **Pitch Writer Agent**: Creates personalized outreach messages
4. **Outreach Agent**: Sends emails via SMTP

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python async framework)
- SQLite (zero-setup database)
- Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (LLM for all agents)
- SMTP for email delivery

**Frontend:**
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Context for state management
- Axios for API calls

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Activate virtual environment (created by uv):
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Add your Google Gemini API key to `.env`:
```bash
# Edit backend/.env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key
```

To get a Gemini API key:
- Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- Click "Get API Key" or use existing GCP project
- Copy the API key (starts with "AIza...")

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend will run at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies (if not already done):
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

1. **Create a Job Posting**
   - Fill out the job form with title, description, skills, experience level, and location
   - Click "Create Job & Start Sourcing"
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for AI agents to generate and rank candidates

2. **Review Candidates**
   - View candidate profiles with match scores and key highlights
   - Use keyboard shortcuts:
     - `←` or `X` to reject
     - `→` or `Enter` to accept
   - Or use the on-screen buttons

3. **Accept Candidates**
   - When you accept a candidate, the Pitch Writer Agent creates a personalized email
   - The Outreach Agent sends the email (in demo mode, it's logged to console)
   - View the generated pitch in the modal

4. **Source More Candidates**
   - Click "Source More Candidates" button to generate a fresh batch (15 new candidates)
   - Useful when you want more options or different candidate profiles

## Features

✅ **Core Flow:**
- Job description input form
- Mock candidate generation (20-25 profiles initially)
- "Source More Candidates" button (generates fresh batch on demand)
- AI-powered matching with scores (0-100)
- Flashcard UI with key highlights
- Accept/reject with buttons and keyboard shortcuts
- Personalized pitch generation
- Email sending via SMTP (demo mode logs to console)
- Stats display

✅ **Agentic Behavior:**
- Each agent makes independent decisions
- Varied, non-templated outputs
- Context-aware generation
- Multi-factor reasoning

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/jobs` - Create job + trigger sourcing pipeline
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/candidates` - Get next candidate to review
- `PUT /api/candidates/{id}/accept` - Accept candidate & generate pitch
- `PUT /api/candidates/{id}/reject` - Reject candidate
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/stats` - Get review statistics
- `POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/source-more` - Generate fresh batch of candidates

## Demo Tips

For best demo experience:

1. **Create a realistic job posting** (e.g., "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS)
2. **Show the multi-agent system working**:
   - Point out the sourcing phase (generating diverse candidates)
   - Highlight the matching scores and reasoning
   - Accept a candidate to show pitch generation
3. **Demonstrate "Source More"** - Click it to show agents generating fresh candidates in real-time
4. **Show keyboard shortcuts** - Fast reviewing with arrow keys
5. **Display the generated email** - Show how personalized it is

## Notes

- Candidates are mock data generated by AI (not real LinkedIn profiles)
- In demo mode, emails are logged to console instead of actually sent
- To send real emails, configure SMTP settings in `backend/.env` and uncomment the SMTP code in `agents.py`
- Database is SQLite file-based (`recruiter.db` in backend directory)

## Cost Estimation

With Google Gemini 2.0 Flash:
- ~$0.02 per 1000 candidates generated
- With $20 GCP credits, you can run 1000+ iterations

## Hackathon Value Proposition

This project demonstrates:
- **Clear utility**: Solves real recruiter pain points
- **Genuine agentic AI**: Multi-agent system with independent decision-making
- **Technical depth**: Agent orchestration, structured LLM outputs, state management
- **Product thinking**: Thoughtful UX, keyboard shortcuts, progress tracking
- **Demo potential**: Visual, easy to understand, works end-to-end
